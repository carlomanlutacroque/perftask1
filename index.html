<h2>Pozzarello</h2>

 The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended
 the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat.
 This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>

</a>This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna,
and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>

The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets,
sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>

The historical hilltop city of Siena was established by Etruscans several centuries BC. The present name of the city - Saena Julia - was mentioned in Roman writings in the 1st century AD.</p>

<h2>Sweets</h2>

I love desserts. I love pastries. Every meal is never complete without something sweet to end it. I love eating sweet foof specialy pastries</p>

<h2>Lavender</h2>

The scent of lavender is floral and sweet and also has herbal notes with balsamic undertones. Because of its mild and pleasant scent, lavender is commonly used in cleaning products and for scenting clothes and body products.</p>
